# si-units
## Summary
An implementation of a set of SI units, based on the Kg-m-s triplet.
It is a typesafe set of classes that behave coherently in regard with the operation applied to them 
(multiplication, division, additionâ€¦).
This lib requires a C++14-compliant compiler.

## Installation
This is almost a header-only lib, except for a few iostream-based functionalities. To use the whole library, just include the "Units.h" header into your source code, and add the "Units.cpp" to your build toolchain.
